This project is creates the app that a member of a climbing league at a rock climbing gym would use during the league day. The user will add the climbs and boulders as they do them, and at the end of the league day they will enter their ID for Sum_scores, which will put their score for the week- their average score into the score of their team. It will also recaculate their average score, reset their current score for next week, and increment the number of weeks that they've competed in the league. My app uses the root mysql server, so if you want to use this app, you'll have to run the SQL queries in Climbing_Queries.sql in your own server. 

This app doesn't include any functions to add climbs/members/teams/gyms, because this app would be just for those competing, as it wouldn't really make sense if anyone could just add tuples into the database. There would have to also be a seperate app for employees to add new climbing routes, teams, and team members.
